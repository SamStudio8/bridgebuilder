=============

[Sir Benjamin Baker KCB KCMG FRS FRSE] [1] was an eminent English civil engineer who worked in the mid to late Victorian era. He is best known for his work on the [Forth Bridge] [2].

The baker component of the BridgeBuilder system takes as input the old and new references and outputs a "bridge" FASTA that consists only of areas in the new reference that are changed between old and new (excepting coordinate changes).
