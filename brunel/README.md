bridgebuilder - brunel
=============

[Isambard Kingdom Brunel, FRS] [1] was a mechanical and civil engineer who, among many other engineering projects in Victorian England, built numerous important bridges including the [Clifton Suspension Bridge] [2]. 

The brunel component of the BridgeBuilder system takes as input a sorted BAM in the original coordinate system and a [LiftOver chain] [3] file and outputs two BAM files: 
   * A sorted BAM in the new coordinates (consisting of reads whose order has not changed from old to new)
   * An unsorted BAM in new coordinates (consisting of reads whose order has changed from old to new)
