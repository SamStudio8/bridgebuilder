bridgebuilder - brunel
=============

[Isambard Kingdom Brunel, FRS] [1] was a mechanical and civil engineer who, among many other engineering projects in Victorian England, built numerous important bridges including the [Clifton Suspension Bridge] [2]. 

The brunel component of the BridgeBuilder system takes as inputs the coordinate sorted BAMs from the previous bridgebuilder steps and produces as output the final merged BAM file.
